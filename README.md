The assignment for this lab was:

```Write a sketch in which two sprites are drawn using functions. One sprite is a character (such as Mario) and the other is an item (such as coin). You should be able to move the character using the arrow keys. The item sprite should spawn randomly and the goal will be to move the character to get the item. When the character gets the item, you make the character animate. Then, add to the previous script where the item disappears after the character gets it. Last, spawn the item 5 items randomly until the character gets them all.```

I chose to make a witch (symbolized by a witch hat) that is collecting spellbook pages. The arrow keys are used to move the witch hat up, down, left, and right with the corresponding arrow keys. When the witch hat is close enough to the page, it will turn green instead of its usual black. When it is a little closer, it will "collect" the page and spawn a new one. When each page is collected, the console will print an updated message with a count of how many have been collected so far. When the user collects 5, the game is over and no more movement can happen until the player presses the play button again.
